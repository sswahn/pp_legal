      <h1>Trial Overview - Canada</h1>
      <p>When you order your 14-day trial of Ingredient Science, you must pay a shipping and handling fee of $4.95 plus tax for us to send you a 30-day trial supply of Ingredient Science. We allow up to 3-5 days for you to receive the trial supply. Thus, in order for you to have 14 days to try the product, we consider the end date for your trial period to be 18 days after you place your order, which is 14 days plus 3-5 days for processing and transit. If you like how Ingredient Science helps you meet your weight loss goals, do nothing – you´ll be charged the discounted price of $89.41 plus tax at the end of your trial period. If for any reason you decide Ingredient Science is not for you, call Customer Care toll free at 888-703-9850 anytime during your 14-day trial period to cancel. Then simply return the product (even if it is empty!) and you will NEVER be billed any additional amount. If you decide to keep the product, you will receive a fresh supply of the Ingredient Science approximately every 30 days at the same low price of $89.41 plus $4.95 S&H and tax.</p>
      <p>You can cancel anytime by calling Customer Care at 888-703-9850. No risk, no obligation to buy today, cancel any time!</p>
      <p>By entering your account information and clicking the SUBMIT button, you agree to the offer terms and authorize Ingredient Science to charge your account at the end of the 14-day trial and with each monthly shipment on the terms described above.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Please be advised that your account may be debited by our international merchant account, and your issuing bank may charge a small international processing fee. Please be advised that Ingredient Science is not responsible for any processing fees that your bank may impose on your account.</p>
